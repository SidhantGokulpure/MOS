# MOS

A multiprogramming operating system allows multiple programs to run on a computer simultaneously. It aims to maximize CPU usage and throughput.

Objective: The main objective of multiprogramming is to keep the CPU busy all the time by executing multiple programs simultaneously.

Key Features:
      **Concurrency**: Multiple programs are loaded into memory and executed concurrently.
      **Time Sharing**: CPU time is shared among multiple programs using scheduling algorithms.
      **Efficiency**: Improves system efficiency by overlapping I/O operations with CPU operations.
      **Resource Allocation**: Efficiently manages system resources such as memory and CPU.
      
Advantages:
      **Higher CPU Utilization**: The CPU is kept busy executing tasks, maximizing its utilization.
      **Improved Throughput**: Multiple programs running concurrently mean more work is done in the same amount of time.
      **Better Resource Utilization**: System resources like memory and I/O devices are utilized more efficiently.
      
Components:
      **Memory Management**: Allocates memory to multiple programs in such a way that they don't interfere with each other's execution.
      **Processor Scheduling**: Chooses which program to run next and for how long, optimizing CPU utilization.
      **I/O Management**: Overlaps I/O operations with CPU processing to minimize idle time.
      **File System**: Manages access to files and directories among multiple programs.
